         <br><br><p style=" text-align:left; font-family:georgia" ><h3>4)  GENERAL BOOKING TERMS (APPLY TO ALL TRAVEL PRODUCTS)</h3></p>
<br><br><b>DETAILS AND PRICE</b>
 <br><br>You confirm that all details provided by you when making your booking (such as name, ID details, contact details, payment details and dates) are accurate and complete. If you notify us of any incorrect details provided by you by mistake, we will help you try and change the details on the booking however we cannot guarantee that the Supplier will permit this, in particular where a change could amount to a change in identity.   
<br><br>We advertise a large number of Travel Products and we try hard to ensure that the advertised price is always accurate, but sometimes errors do occur. If the error should reasonably have been apparent to you, we reserve the right to cancel the booking or (if agreed by you) change the price. If this happens, we will contact you.
<br><br><b>BOOKING PROCESS</b>
<br><br>When your booking is complete, you will receive a confirmation email from us. You agree to check the details in the booking confirmation and to contact us immediately if any of the details are incorrect. More information on flight and hotel booking confirmations is in the relevant sections below.

We will inform you as soon as possible after you place a booking if, for any reason, the Travel Product you have sought to book with us is not available.
<br><br><b>PAYMENT AND CURRENCY</b>
<br><br>When you book a Travel Product, the terms of payment will be made clear to you during the booking process.

If any sum is not paid in full in accordance with the terms of your booking, we may cancel your booking immediately.
<br><br>Exchange rates are calculated in real time. When you prepay online, you will pay the exact amount shown on the payment page. However, if you are paying in a different currency, the provider of the account you pay with may use an alternative currency rate which you are responsible for confirming. Your account provider may also charge you a fee for international payments. You acknowledge that when you pay at the time of using the Travel Product (for e.g., when you check-in at a hotel) the exchange rate may have changed between the time of booking and the time of payment.
<br><br>If you encounter a problem when you submit your payment, please do not submit the payment again. You can confirm whether your booking was successfully made by contacting us using the details in section 1 of these terms.
<br><br>Any refunds will be paid back to the original payment method, unless we agree otherwise. The date that any refund will be paid into your account is subject to the provider of your account.
